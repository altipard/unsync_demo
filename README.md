# Tutorial - using unsync library

This is a short tutorial using the **unsync** library in Python for parallelising code. I thought this was easier than using **asyncio** or **threading** and there are few tutorials on the **unsync** library

## Tutorial article

Check out the [tutorial article on Medium here](https://medium.com/@MattGosden/tutorial-using-pythons-unsync-library-to-make-an-asynchronous-trading-bot-9ee2ae881272?source=friends_link&sk=d5e1d2b65131ff673b23ceef37de29d4).

## Files

1. The _bot.py_ file contains an example of a synchronous trading bot that we will parallelise.

2. The _bot_unsync.py_ file contains this same code but now working in parallel using the **unsync** library
