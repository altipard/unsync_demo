# Tutorial - using unsync library

This is a short tutorial using the **unsync** library in Python for parallelising code. I thought this was easier than using **asyncio** or **threading** and there are few tutorials on the **unsync** library

##

1. The bot.py file contains an example of a synchronous trading bot that we will parallelise.

2. The bot_unsync.py file contains this same code but now working in parallel using the **unsync** library
